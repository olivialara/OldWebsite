          This is Roo. Her favorite activities are sleeping and being sassy.
          She loves being teasing Tigerlily and looking at the birds and bunnies outside.
          She can frquently be found in Emma's room found under the covers.
          If I had to describe her in two words it would be sassy and plump.
