          My family consists of five family members: my dad, my mom, Raquel, and Emma.<br/>
          <br/>
          My older sister is twenty-eight and my little sister is seventeen. I am really close
          to both of my sisters. We like to eat and shop together. <br/>
          <br/>
          My dad is a psyciatrist. He is also a also a speaker that talks
          about nutrition, exercise and the brain and travels all around
          United States to give these talks. My mom helps my dad in the office
          and travels with him. They both inspire me to be the best I can be.
          I am so happy I have them in my life.
